file for details.

ELinks 0.12.GIT now:
--------------------

To be released as ELinks 0.12.0.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
This list now contains all the important changes from ELinks 0.11.0 to
ELinks 0.12.GIT (a831beb6c80957606967d8f34b9046ed8178a0b2) and related
bug numbers.  Each section is sorted by severity and grouped by topic.

The list no doubt includes several changes that are not really
important enough.  Please move them to the separate "should be removed
from NEWS" list below, or coalesce several changes into one entry (but
do list all bug numbers).
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Notable new features:

* enhancement 822: UTF-8 as terminal charset, not merely UTF-8 I/O
  of a unibyte codepage as in previous versions.  Double-cell (aka
  fullwidth) and supplementary characters work too, but combining
  characters and right-to-left text do not.  The only multibyte
  charset ELinks can decode is still UTF-8, so if the server outputs
  e.g. Shift-JIS, you'd better recode with a proxy.  See more notes
  in features.conf.
* enhancement 844: SMB protocol using libsmbclient.  This replaces
  the smbclient-based code that was disabled in ELinks 0.11.2.

Incompatibilities:

* ECMAScript support is now disabled by default.  It has known
  bugs 548 and 771 with which malicious web pages can hang ELinks,
  and its security goals are undocumented.  If you must enable
  ECMAScript support, it would be prudent to restrict the ELinks
  process with a sandbox of some kind.
* ECMAScript support no longer works with SpiderMonkey versions
  earlier than JS1.5 RC3a.
* Gzip decompression support now requires zlib 1.2.0.2 or later.
* bugs 871, 752: The numbering of terminal.*.colors no longer depends
  on config options.  This change makes elinks.conf portable between
  different configurations but unfortunately not between this and
  previous versions.
* Changed Python goto_url_hook(current) to goto_url_hook(new).  The
  hook can call the new function elinks.current_url() if desired.
  The Python scripting back-end is much more featureful than in
  previous releases, but it is still considered experimental.
* Guile scripting reads hooks.scm rather than internal-hooks.scm.
  (It still reads user-hooks.scm, too.)

Miscellaneous:

* critical bug 723: fix dangling pointer crash when following a link
  in a frame
* critical bug 756: ``assertion (cached)->object.refcount >= 0 failed''
  after HTTP proxy was changed
* critical bug 869: long mailcap entry buffer overflow (non-security)
  when downloading
* tabs opened by -remote now go behind existing dialogs
* Debian bug 257762: turn terminal transparency off by default
* bug 724: better parsing of escape sequences and control
  sequences from the terminal
* bug 948: fix wrong UTF-8 output after the charset menu was used
* gzip_read: always call gzclearerr
* bug 816: convert entity references in input/@value only once
* bug 916: if a mailcap entry has no %s, provide the file as stdin
* bug 744: don't change ``//'' to ``/'' in URIs
* bug 766: speed up CSS
* bug 355: add documents displayed via ``What to do'' dialog to the
  global history
* encode and decode filenames in FSP URLs
* don't use a busy cache entry if it has expired or should be
  reloaded.  See elinks-users mail from 28 Oct 2005.
* several accesskey fixes
* in Lua: don't write to the string returned by lua_tostring
* minor bug 972: preserve the background color and underlining in
  spaces when justifying
* minor bug 284: render closing bracket for HTML element SUB in the
  same line; don't let it fall to the next
* minor: show quote characters for HTML element Q, rather than italics
* trivial bug 387: treat &#013; inside <pre>...</pre> as a newline
* trivial bug 930: refresh status bar when key prefix is eaten
* trivial bug 776: ``elinks -remote http://elinks.cz/'' no longer clears
  the screen
* enhancement 121: if a mailcap entry indicates 'copiousoutput', ELinks
  itself acts as a pager
* enhancement 790: If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match
* enhancement: HTTP negotiate-auth using GSSAPI
* enhancement 517: fixed and enabled HTTP bzip2 decompression
* enhancement: LZMA decompression
* enhancement: FSP progress indicator and password prompt
* enhancement: autocreate directories needed to download a file
* enhancement: ``Add server'' button in the cookie manager
* enhancement 887: ``Save'' in the cookie manager now saves cookies
  even if unmodified
* enhancement 145: internal clipboard support
* enhancement: new main actions move-cursor-line-start,
  move-link-down-line, move-link-left-line, move-link-right-line,
  move-link-up-line
* enhancement: new edit actions kill-word-back, move-backward-word,
  move-forward-word
* enhancements 687, 688: options ui.tabs.top, ui.show_menu_bar_always
* enhancement: highlight links as one enters link prefixes
* enhancement: backspace backs out the last digit of the prefix
* enhancement: in text type-ahead searching, don't follow current link
  on enter
* enhancement: add support for parsing space separated CSS class
  attribute values
* enhancement: make meta refresh content attribute parsing more tolerant

  elinks.execute, elinks.globhist, elinks.load_uri, elinks.vs

Build system and compile-time errors (ignore if you don't build ELinks):

* bug 725: fix version checking for Ruby in 'configure'
* enhancement: if make -k was used and a sub-Make fails, build the
  rest before propagating
* enhancement: avoid compilation of vernum.c in 'make install'
* enhancement: make uninstall
* experimental enhancements: --with-python=DIRECTORY, --with-gc=DIRECTORY
* experimental enhancement: Win32 port (build with MinGW MSYS)

Changes in the experimental ECMAScript support:

* disabled by default, as mentioned under ``Incompatibilities'' above
* execute event-handler scripts as function bodies, so ``return''
  statements work as intended
* fix error ``forms.namedItem is not a function''
* enhancement: SEE ECMAScript backend, an alternative to SpiderMonkey
* enhancement: handling onsubmit
* workaround: window.open remembers the last few URLs and doesn't
  reopen them when incremental rendering reruns the onload script
* enhancement: better handling of form.action assignments
* enhancement: form[x] looks up controls also by 'id', not only 'name'
* enhancement: added document.location.href, input.selectedIndex,
  window.setTimeout, window.status

Changes in the experimental NNTP client:

* HTML escape header field values
* Add support for handling RFC2047 encoded words
* Improve listing of articles for groups

Changes in the experimental SGML/DOM implementation:

* enhancement: minimalistic RSS renderer
* enhancement: source highlighting also recognizes
  application/xhtml+xml and application/docbook+xml.  It doesn't yet
  support arbitrary XML though.
* enhancement: make it possible to use more CSS properties with the
  source highlighting
* enhancement: handle <base href=""> for HTML source rendering
* enhancement: add support for scanning comment endings such as
  '--!>' correctly
* enhancement: incremental parsing
* and more.

  * support much longer locale-specific timestamps when formatting a
    directory listing.  LC_TIME=fi_FI.UTF-8 now works.  Let's treat
    this as part of the UTF-8 support.

    "error"
  * Really retry forever when connection.retries = 0
